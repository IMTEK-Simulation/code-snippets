# Code Snippets

This repository contains a random collection of code snippets for pre- and 
postprocessing simulation runs with Ovito, ASE and other tools.

Note that some parts of the repository below `imteksimcs` installable as a
python package.

Please categorize additions as follows:

- Loose snippets go into an according subfolder here (the repositiory's root).
  If no suitable folder exists, create it.
- Importable python modules go into an according subfilder below `imteksimcs`.
  If no suitable folder exists, create it and touch an `__init__.py`.
- (Installable) command line interfaces go into an according subfolder below 
  `imteksimcs/cli`. If no suitable folder exists, create it and touch an 
  `__init__.py`. Add an entry point to `setup.py` accordingly.

Ideally, the names of categorical folders should agree on all of those three
levels.
