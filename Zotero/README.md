# Zotero-related snippets

* better-bibtex:
  (Better BibTex)[http://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/] (BBT) facilitates 
  BibTex export from Zotero. Customize export by inserting JavaScript snippets
  at "Edit->Preferences->Better BibTex->Advanced->postscript" within Zotero
  after installation of BBT.
  * abbreviateFirstNames.js replaces all whitespace-separated components of
    authors' first names by initials as long as a component's first character
    is recognized as a letter. Sample: "Johannes Laurin the 2nd" should turn
    into "J. L. t. 2nd".
